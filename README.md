# 🛕 Varanasi Weekend Trip Plan

## 🔑 Key Points (Why & Trip Focus)
- **Why not Ayodhya or Prayagraj:**  
  - **Ayodhya:** 200 km (~4–5 hrs drive one-way), limited return flights, too tight for a weekend day trip.  
  - **Prayagraj:** 120 km (~2.5–3 hrs drive), direct Bangalore return requires 36–42 hr train/bus or limited flights, not feasible for a weekend.  
- Focus on **Varanasi + nearby sightseeing** for a balanced experience of culture, history, and nature.  
- Smooth logistics for weekend travelers with evening return flight.  
- Mix of spiritual, historical, and natural attractions.
