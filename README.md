- Neutral Vibe: No romantic/party-centric locations
- Minimal Stress: Single destination focus, Friday night travel maximizes weekend

---

**Final Prompt:**

Suggest a weekend trip from Bangalore for two adults in their late 30s who are meeting for the first time.

This is not a date and not a romantic trip. The focus is on comfort, ease, and minimizing social awkwardness.

Please prioritize:

- Short, stress-free travel (easy drives or quick connections)
- Calm, neutral destinations (not couple-centric, party-heavy, or honeymoon-oriented)
- Access to spiritual, heritage, or cultural places such as temples, monasteries, historical sites, museums, or old towns
- Good hotels or resorts with private rooms and shared common areas
- Flexible, low-pressure activities like sightseeing, quiet walks, cafés, spiritual visits, or cultural exploration
- Safety, cleanliness, and reliable infrastructure

Avoid:

- Romantic or intimate settings
- High-adrenaline or physically demanding activities
- Tight schedules or situations that force constant interaction

Bonus: Prefer destinations where each person can independently enjoy the place—even spiritual or cultural sites—if conversation dips, without it feeling awkward.

Travel timeframe: Friday night departure, return Sunday. Flight up to 3 hours from Bangalore is acceptable.

Include:

- One destination per option (avoid mixing multiple cities)
- Hour-by-hour itinerary for Friday night to Sunday
- Hotels with private rooms and shared spaces
- Budget estimates
- Typical flight options and fares.
