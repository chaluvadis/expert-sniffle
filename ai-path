Create a high-resolution horizontal triptych abstract painting (16:9 aspect ratio). The composition is divided into three vertical columns with thin, minimalistic borders subtly blended into the painting. The borders must feel organic and integrated, never rigid or sharply separated.

The entire artwork carries a soft atmospheric undertone inspired by Varanasi at dawn — spiritual, calm, and abstract, never literal. Do not depict realistic buildings or landscapes. Only suggest Varanasi through texture, geometry, color transitions, and woven design language.

Across all three panels, include a very faint horizontal current resembling the flow of the Ganga river, subtly connecting the triptych as a unifying element. A diffused saffron-rose dawn glow should gently blend into cooler indigo tones across the painting, creating sacred morning ambience.

LEFT COLUMN — Masculine Energy (Grounded, Reflective)
Abstract, mature, and stable composition using:
- Deep indigo
- Burnt sienna
- Temple-stone grey
- Subtle metallic undertones

Incorporate flowing organic lines combined with faint geometric structure, symbolizing 15+ years in IT experience, logic, discipline, and maturity. Include extremely subtle stepped, layered forms inspired by Varanasi ghats embedded in the deep background texture — abstracted stone-like planes, not architectural illustrations.

Brushwork should be confident, layered, reflective, and gently directional toward the center column. Use acrylic and oil hybrid texture with visible canvas grain and gallery-quality detail.

RIGHT COLUMN — Feminine Energy (Saree-Inspired with Varanasi Design Language)
Abstract and elegant, inspired by Kanchipuram or Dharmavaram sarees. Use rich jewel tones:
- Maroon
- Peacock blue
- Muted gold
- Deep green

The saree-inspired paint texture should incorporate woven design elements subtly inspired by Varanasi:
- Flowing river-line motifs woven into the textile-like pattern
- Delicate stepped geometric forms inspired by ghats
- Extremely faint temple-curve or shikhara-inspired silhouettes
- Gentle mirrored strokes suggesting river reflection
- Light golden mist woven softly into the texture

All of these must appear as woven textile patterns within the paint — not illustrations, not literal scenery.

Brush strokes should be fluid, graceful, restrained, and culturally refined. No jewelry, no flashy ornamentation. The brushwork and fabric flow should softly guide the eye toward the center column.

CENTER COLUMN — Union of Exploration (Meeting in Varanasi)
This column represents convergence — two journeys meeting at the river.

Blend tones from both sides harmoniously:
- Indigo merging with peacock blue
- Burnt sienna softening into maroon
- Muted gold interacting with metallic grey

Include subtle kolam-inspired line work — delicate, balanced, and geometric. Allow a gentle saffron dawn glow to radiate softly from within this column. Incorporate faint reflective symmetry in the lower portion, symbolizing river reflection and introspection.

Integrate the following message directly into the paint texture in simple, readable English. It should feel hand-painted into the canvas, slightly textured, organically embedded, not digitally overlaid:

“This day is a small reminder of the conversations and ideas we’ve shared so far, and the exploration ahead.
Every interaction teaches us something new about each other and ourselves.
We approach this time thoughtfully, paying attention and respecting each other’s individuality as we continue to learn and discover.
We are taking this time to understand and appreciate the perspectives each of us brings.”

The typography should be subtle, contemplative, mature, softly blended into the paint surface.

OVERALL STYLE
- Abstract painting
- High detail
- Acrylic and oil hybrid texture
- Visible canvas grain
- Realistic brush strokes
- Gallery-quality finish
- Mature and reflective tone
- Subtle elegance and cultural resonance
- Natural merging of colors and textures across columns
- Balanced composition with shared visual focus toward the center
- Spiritual undertone inspired by Varanasi at dawn
- No literal landmarks, no heavy contrast, no exaggerated effects

The final result should feel contemplative, sacred yet grounded, emotionally intelligent, culturally rooted, and unified — like two perspectives meeting gently by the river at dawn.
